# PsQ---Syntax-of-Sudoku-v2.0
Updated version, still under construction. 
See https://github.com/A-Lex-McLee/Sudoku_Grid_Syntax for a description of the base version.


Innovations in v2:
* use of Numpy instead of lists/tuples for grid operations
* class GridCollection to deal with collections of Sudoku grids, permutation series, false grids, one-hot encoding, and to produce train_test datasets e.g. for ML applications
* GUI, which is currently just for illustration
